<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I'm Francis C. Njoku, a Web Developer, started coding and programming at age 31 and I am loving it, worked for First March Communication
     in partner with MTNNIG, practically I worked in the telecomm industry as a Customer Care Representative for 6 years and 9 months then 
     I resigned amicable because I needed a new challenge in the IT world despite not having knowledge of any science subject, I’m a pure Art 
     student in my Secondary School days then Studied Office Technology and Management in Akanu Ibiam Federal Polytechnic Unwanna, Afikpo 
     Ebonyi State, Where I got my first Diploma in Office Tech and Mgt with few other certificates through online classes due to the nature of
     my job. I had the believe I can do it since I'm a good problem solver, I’m always the best in everything I do. I was inspired by my neighbor 
     who is coding guru to switch career, at that point nothing else interests me to do, to me it's a challenge and I entertain them a lot. 
     All thanks to Mr. Uyuho Isaac Eduok who inspired me to taking this great step.

    I have taken some crazy decisions that only 3 of 10 persons can take, today I'm very delighted of those decisions, one of it was deciding 
    to go back and repeat SS1 Note: This decision was on my own, I did not fail any class or was told by anyone to do that. I will tell you why
     I took decision in few seconds... I was a very brilliant boy in my Primaries haven gone through a private Primary School, my JSS1 to 3 was
      okay but my SSI to SS2 was terrible due to peer group and community I grew in (Ore, Ondo st.) family background also affected me because no 
      one cares as long as you’re helping the family with some expense, I became someone who will leave the class through the window when the 
      lecture is on, school closing hour was 2 but my friends and I will leave by 12noon just to meet up with “first bus” to sell stuffs like 
      banana, sometimes cola, sometimes bottle water and so on... My brother-in-law (I call him Uncle Sam) changed my life for coming to ask my 
      parents he wanted me to live with him. When I got here (Epe) in the year 2006, I made the decision of not been admitted into SS3 although
       that’s the class I should’ve started with, I was extremely lacking behind some knowledge, so I decided to start from SS1, I became the 
       Assistant Senior Prefect on completion of my SS3, from here you can tell this was my turning point. 
    I regained all lost lectures and knowledge.

    learn about their culture, so far I have been to 9 different countries which I'm proud of. Making me the youngest tourister in my Community,
